## TRINITY CHART SYSTEM

### Chart Structure (Center, Gate, Line, Color, Tone, Base, Degree, Minute, Second)

Each person has activations in five fields:
- **Mind Field**: Mental pressure, realization, thought patterns
- **Body Field**: Physical expression, survival, biological intelligence
- **Heart Field**: Emotional intelligence, love, feeling-centered awareness
- **Soul Field**: Inner truth, soul recognition, deeper knowing
- **Spirit Field**: Universal connection, transcendence, cosmic awareness

### Gate System (64 Gates)
Based on I Ching hexagrams, each gate represents:
- Specific consciousness quality
- Biological codon mapping
- Elemental resonance
- Geometric perception pattern

### Layers of Depth
1. **Gate**: Core archetype (1-64)
2. **Line**: Expression mode (1-6)
3. **Color**: Perception filter (1-6)
4. **Tone**: Frequency (1-6)
5. **Base**: Fundamental orientation (1-5)

## SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE SYNTAX

### Core Operators

- **• (Singularity)**: Pre-collapse seed, infinite potential
- **. (Transitioner)**: Step inward, descent to next chamber
- **° (Collapse)**: Anchor into coordinate (phase/degree)
- **: (Portal)**: Threshold between chambers/modes
- **; (Fork)**: Branch into divergent streams
- **, (Breath)**: Pause, collect fragments
